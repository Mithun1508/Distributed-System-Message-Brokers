## Introduction
Modern distributed systems often face challenges in managing communication among various services. The Distributed System Message Broking Log Monitoring project addresses these challenges by providing a flexible and decoupled architecture. It combines Websocket for real-time communication, Netflix OSS for microservices architecture, Kafka for distributed messaging, and Microservices to create a powerful solution.

## Architecture
The project architecture is designed around microservices, each playing a specific role in the system:

1 Websocket Service: Enables real-time bidirectional communication.

2 Netflix OSS: Facilitates service discovery, configuration, and dynamic routing.

3 Kafka: Serves as a distributed message broker for scalable communication.

4 Microservices: Custom services for implementing business logic.
For a more detailed understanding of the architecture, please refer to the Architecture Documentation.

## Features
1. Message Brokering:
   
Implementing a message broker allows for:

Message Validation: Ensure the integrity and validity of incoming messages.

Transformation: Modify message formats to suit the needs of different services.

Routing: Efficiently direct messages to their intended recipients.

2. Microservices Architecture
   
Utilize Netflix OSS for:

Service Discovery: Automatically locate and connect to services.

Configuration: Dynamically manage configurations for each microservice.

3. Distributed Messaging
   
Leverage Kafka for:

Scalable and Reliable Messaging: Ensure messages are delivered reliably and at scale.

Decoupling Services: Minimize dependencies among microservices.

4. Log Monitoring
   
Enhance system observability with:

Centralized Logging: Aggregate logs from different microservices.

Real-time Monitoring: Monitor logs in real-time for immediate issue detection.
